# VirtualPlaybackKeys

## The problem
My new [Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/b/sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-for-business) is really nice, but there's one feature that it doesn't have that I miss: dedicated media playback (play / pause, next track, previous track) keys.  

## The solution
Add global hotkeys that emulate the media playback keys. 

The mapping is:

* `Windows`+`Shift`+`{`: previous track
* `Windows`+`Shift`+`}`: next track
* `Windows`+`Shift`+`|`: play / pause

The emulation should work with any program that supports the physical media playback keys (eg. Spotify, iTunes, Media Player, VLC). Note that some programs may only work if they're in the foreground. 

## Installation and use
If you'd like this to start up every time you log in, copy the .exe available from [the releases page](https://github.com/charleskorn/VirtualPlaybackKeys/releases) into your Startup folder, which is usually something like `C:\Users\(your name)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`. (The easiest way to find your startup folder is to open `shell:startup` using Run.)

As long as the program is running, the hotkeys will work. There is no UI or notification area icon.
